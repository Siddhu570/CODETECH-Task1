Project Overview: Grade Calculator in Python:-

Introduction:
I have developed a Grade Calculator application in Python as part of my summer internship project. This program aims to automate the process of calculating final grades based on input scores for assignments, quizzes, and exams. It's designed to be user-friendly, efficient, and capable of handling various grading scales and input scenarios.

**Objective:**
The main objective of this project is to create a tool that simplifies the grade calculation process for students or users. By allowing them to input their scores for different components and applying predefined grading criteria, the Grade Calculator provides accurate and quick feedback on their overall performance.

**Key Features:**
1. **Input Handling:** Users can input scores for assignments, quizzes, and exams through a straightforward interface.
   
2. **Grade Calculation:** The program computes the final grade based on weighted averages or specified formulas, adhering to defined grading scales (e.g., A, B, C) and thresholds.

3. **Error Management:** Robust error handling ensures that the application gracefully manages incorrect inputs and unexpected scenarios, providing clear prompts or messages for users.

4. **Flexibility:** Designed to accommodate various grading schemes or custom weightings, allowing for adaptability across different educational contexts.


**Conclusion:**
Developing the Grade Calculator in Python has been a rewarding experience, allowing me to apply my programming skills to solve a practical problem. This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in Python but also showcases my ability to design and implement an effective software solution. It serves as a valuable addition to my internship portfolio, highlighting my dedication to delivering reliable and user-centric applications.
